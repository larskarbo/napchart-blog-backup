If you have and idea or an issue, I would love to help you\nand mentor you to do that yourself.\n\nFor non-programmers (most of you I guess) you can still contribute by sending\nfeedback and providing issues and ideas.\n\n * How can Napchart be better?\n * How can more people get use of Napchart?","feature_image":"/content/images/2018/01/napchart.jpg","featured":0,"page":0,"status":"published","locale":null,"visibility":"public","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"author_id":"1","created_at":"2018-01-27T17:06:13.000Z","created_by":"1","updated_at":"2018-01-28T09:25:38.000Z","updated_by":"1","published_at":"2018-01-27T17:42:35.000Z","published_by":"1","custom_excerpt":null,"codeinjection_head":"","codeinjection_foot":"","og_image":null,"og_title":null,"og_description":null,"twitter_image":null,"twitter_title":null,"twitter_description":null,"custom_template":null},{"id":"5a6ef11ef4369e67aa0a74c1","uuid":"6305a0c8-6501-483c-99db-fc0287a46153","title":"Update on text size","slug":"update-on-text-size","mobiledoc":"{\"version\":\"0.3.1\",\"markups\":[],\"atoms\":[],\"cards\":[[\"card-markdown\",{\"cardName\":\"card-markdown\",\"markdown\":\"An issue on [GitHub](https://github.com/larskarbo/napchart/issues/43) by Tinytimrob made me aware that the font size of that the new version of Napchart is darn hard to see on thumb previews on sites like Discord.\\n\\nPrevious version vs new version:\\n\\n![687474703a2f2f7777772e74696e7974696d726f622e636f6d2f6d656469612f7468756d626e61696c5f636f6d70617269736f6e2e706e67-1](/content/images/2018/01/687474703a2f2f7777772e74696e7974696d726f622e636f6d2f6d656469612f7468756d626e61696c5f636f6d70617269736f6e2e706e67-1.png)\\n\\nThis is a major accessibility issue, as people have to click every link in order to see how the chart is instead of seeing most of the information in the thumb.\\n\\n## Changes\\n\\nNew version of `napchart` now features a `baseFontSize` config paramater that defaults to `1`.
