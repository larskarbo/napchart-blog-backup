It has gone through transformations and upgrades, including a different user interfaces and features. Thousands of charts have been saved and shared, and a bunch of people have visited the site every day.</p>\n<p>👋 I am the creator of Napchart. <em>I have blood on my hands</em></p>\n<p>Recently I rolled out a new version with a set of new features:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Pen mode</strong> - allows you to create elements by clicking and dragging</li>\n<li><strong>Choose how many lanes</strong></li>\n<li><strong>More colors</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p><img src=\"/content/images/2018/01/Capture.PNG\" alt=\"Some of the new features on Napchart\"></p>\n<p>Happy and relieved to be finished, I pushed the new version to the website. <em>Without telling anyone, or showing it to anyone.</em> The new update was a big mistake.</p>\n<p>Don't get me wrong. The new update was a real improvement. But I had forgotten some <em>essential</em> features from the previous version.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The back button (history) was missing</li>\n<li>The lock button was missing!</li>\n</ul>\n<p>That's when I realized, I need a closer relationship with the users. I need to listen to the feedback and not <em>break things</em>. Let's build this tool together, lets face the hard problems and make the best version of Napchart possible. <em>For everyone</em></p>\n<h2 id=\"thewayforward\">The way forward</h2>\n<p>First thing I did, was creating the Napchart Blog you are currently reading. Here, I will post announcements and thoughts, I will write new blog posts every time there will be an update.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/content/images/2018/01/Capture-1.PNG\" alt=\"Napchart Blog - Shaping the future of Napchart\"></p>\n<p>One thing we also need to do is make a better <em>feedback and communications system</em>. Right now, with the feedback form, all feedback is sent right to me. And that's great, but I think it would have been better if the feedback could have been read by <em>everyone</em>. Let all of us discuss and share experiences. What works? What doesn't work? This way, we would have better understanding of what is important, and what needs to be done to preserve functionality and user experience.</p>\n<p>I am not sure exactly how to do this, but it may or may not include user registration and login on Napchart. This would also open possibilities for other features like saving charts on your profile and collabarating. What is your opinion on this?</p>\n<p>So far this is some of the feedback submitted through the form:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The lock button</li>\n<li>The history back button</li>\n<li>24 hours / 12 hours (am/pm)</li>\n<li>More lanes than 4?</li>\n<li>Sidebar is misbehaving</li>\n<li>Difficult to read chart (need darker lines)</li>\n<li>Difficult to use on mobile/small screens</li>\n</ul>\n<p><img src=\"/content/images/2018/01/094c3029ba08ed2bc2625082a76e3d27-2.jpg\" alt=\"Napchart can be a pain to use on small devices\"></p>\n<h2 id=\"howcanicontribute\">How can I contribute</h2>\n<p>If you are interested in programming, web or javascript, you can contribute directly on GitHub. If you have and idea or an issue, I would love to help you and mentor you to do that yourself.</p>\n<p>For non-programmers (most of you I guess) you can still contribute by sending feedback and providing issues and ideas.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>How can Napchart be better?</li>\n<li>How can more people get use of Napchart?</li>\n<li>What do you not like with Napchart? What do you like with Napchart?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Feel free to use the comments below, any feedback appreciated 🌟</p>\n</div>","feature_image":"/content/images/2018/01/napchart.jpg","featured":false,"page":false,"locale":null,"visibility":"public","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"created_at":{},"created_by":"1","updated_at":{},"updated_by":"1","published_at":{},"published_by":"1","custom_excerpt":null,"codeinjection_head":"","codeinjection_foot":"","og_image":null,"og_title":null,"og_description":null,"twitter_image":null,"twitter_title":null,"twitter_description":null,"custom_template":null,"tags":{},"author":{"id":"1","name":"Lars Karbo","slug":"lars","profile_image":"//www.gravatar.com/avatar/4579b299730ddc53e3d523ec1cd5482a?s=250&d=mm&r=x","cover_image":null,"bio":null,"website":null,"location":null,"facebook":null,"twitter":null,"accessibility":null,"locale":null,"visibility":"public","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"tour":"[\"getting-started\",\"using-the-editor\",\"static-post\",\"featured-post\",\"upload-a-theme\"]"},"primary_tag":null,"url":"/the-future-of-napchart/","comment_id":"5a6cb1854d0dab4ae5611b2e"},"_locals":{"version":"1.20.3","safeVersion":"1.20","relativeUrl":"/the-future-of-napchart/amp/","secure":true,"client":{"id":"ghost-frontend","secret":"d3a9b7225390"},"context":{"0":"amp","1":"post"}}},"query":{}},"res":{"_headers":{"x-powered-by":"Express","cache-control":"public, max-age=0","content-type":"text/html; charset=utf-8","etag":"W/\"4a5d-RBWg2o3NS8QpGf5XyeVa0gY8uJ8\"","vary":"Accept-Encoding","content-encoding":"gzip"},"statusCode":200,"responseTime":"26ms"},"msg":"","time":"2018-08-06T05:50:44.695Z","v":0}
